### Overview

This repository contains a sliding ICP approach implemented for the kinematic dual laser scanning system of our ground Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), as described in our previous work: [IEEE Xplore Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10302421). 

The system is designed to generate high-resolution point clouds of various crops, including beans, wheat, soybeans, sugar beets, corn, and potatoes, in agricultural fields.

## Key Features

    The U-shape design of the 2×2×2m vehicle causes the scanner calibration relative to the GNSS/IMU trajectory to vary over time when traversing uneven terrains.
    To address this, the method performs sequential calibration updates:
        Creates initial point clouds using rigid mounting calibration.
        Cuts point clouds into overlapping windows along the trajectory.
        Registers these windows with ICP using a symmetric plane-to-plane objective and robust matching.
    Calibration updates are interpolated onto laser data timestamps.
    Final, aligned point clouds are generated by integrating these updates into the direct georeferencing equations for both scanners.

## Installation (Docker), TODO
